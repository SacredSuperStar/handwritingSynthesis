# Text-to-Handwriting

Hey everyone! I hope the person who is reading this is not my teacher.

I hate writing assignments so I made this tool that converts text to an image that looks like handwriting with background of a paperðŸ˜›

Also, I am trying to make this look more realistic and I would love to have people contribute in itðŸŒ»

## This is how output will look

## How to add your own handwriting?
- To use your handwriting, you will have to generate font of your handwriting. 
- You can do that using [Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/en/)
- Once you get .ttf file of your handwriting, just upload it from upload button and boom! you will have your handwriting in the image.
